Challange code for sriraj's TwitterSentimentAnalysis Challange

##Overview

This is the challange submission code for the Twitter Sentiment Analyzer challenge for 'Learn Python for Data Science #2' by @Sirajology on YouTube. The code uses the tweepy library to access the Twitter API and the TextBlob library to perform Sentiment Analysis on each Tweet. We'll be able to see how positive or negative each tweet is about whatever topic we choose.
